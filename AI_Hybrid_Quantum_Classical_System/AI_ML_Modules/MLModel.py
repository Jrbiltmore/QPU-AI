class MLModel:
    """
    Machine learning model that processes player data to adapt game content dynamically.
    This model can be trained on various types of player interaction data to predict behaviors or preferences,
    which can then be used to tailor the VR experience to individual users.

        Train the model on provided data.
        This function should implement training procedures to fit the model to the data,

        Parameters:
            training_data: Data used to train the model. This could be player behavioral data,

        Predict player behavior based on their profile.
        This method uses the trained model to make predictions about player actions,

        Parameters:
            player_profile: A dictionary or object containing player attributes which the model uses to make predictions.
        
        Returns:
            float: A prediction score or probability reflecting certain behavior or preference.
